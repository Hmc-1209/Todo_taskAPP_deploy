### Today's work
- Trying to implement CI flow for API. Still not finished yet.
### Challenges Encountered
- Keep facing problems while building Docker image. It seems that it need a lot of dependencies but some of them need gcc or rust compiler, which is really annoying to install, as it keep saying "not found" though I already installed. The way I fix it is by installing particular toolchain for it.
### Plans for next time
- Continuous tring to complete CI flow for API.
